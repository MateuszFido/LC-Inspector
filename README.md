# LCMSpector

An open-source desktop application for analyzing targeted mass spectrometry (LC/GC-MS) data. Process raw files, trace compounds, compare spectra, and quantify — all locally on your machine. See the [wiki](https://github.com/MateuszFido/LCMSpector/wiki) for full documentation.

## Features

- Trace compounds in raw mass spectrometry data via extracted ion chromatograms (XICs)
- Analyze and process LC/GC chromatograms with automatic baseline correction and peak detection
- View MS spectra scan-by-scan at any retention time
- Overlay and compare multiple files simultaneously on the same plot
- Look up compound m/z values from PubChem by name
- Compute theoretical isotopic patterns from molecular formulas and overlay on spectra
- Predict b/y fragment ions for peptide sequences
- Customize m/z integration boundaries per compound via interactive dialog
- Select from 13 adducts (positive and negative) for m/z calculation
- Quantify concentrations using built-in linear regression calibration
- Look up MS2 spectra on-demand from mzML files for compound verification
- Export plots (SVG, TIFF, PNG, JPG) and data (CSV)
- High-performance mzML parsing via a custom lxml-based reader
- Vendor-agnostic: accepts `.mzML`, `.txt`, and `.csv` files
- Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Installation

### Desktop app

Pre-built executables for Windows, macOS, and Linux are available under [Releases](https://github.com/MateuszFido/LC-Inspector/releases).

- **Windows:** If Windows Defender blocks the app, go to *Protection history*, find the LC-Inspector entry, and click *Restore*. If "Windows protected your PC" appears, click *More info* then *Run anyway*.
- **macOS:** Remove the app from quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/app.app`. Alternatively, go to *System Settings > Privacy & Security* and click *Open Anyway*.

### From source

1. Clone the repository
2. Install [Python 3.13+](https://www.python.org/) and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   uv sync --frozen
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python lcmspector/main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Drag and drop your mass spectrometry and/or chromatography files into the main window
2. Choose a compound list or define your own (compound names are automatically looked up on PubChem)
3. Click **Process**
4. View results: TIC, XICs, labelled chromatograms, and raw MS scans
5. Verify compounds with on-demand MS2 spectrum lookup
6. Quantify using calibration standards

## Docker

Docker is an alternative if you prefer not to install the app directly. Currently Linux-only (requires X11).

You need [Podman](https://podman.io/) or [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (not Docker Desktop — it cannot forward X11 from its VM).

```bash
# Build
podman build -t lcmspector .

# Run (Podman)
xhost +local:
podman run --rm --security-opt label=disable \
  -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix lcmspector
xhost -local:

# Run (Docker Engine) — no --security-opt needed
xhost +local:
docker run --rm -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
  -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix lcmspector
xhost -local:
```

To access local files, mount your data directory: `-v /path/on/host:/data`.
