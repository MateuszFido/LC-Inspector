This package preprocesses, analyzes and annotates LC-MS data. 

It was primarily designed to annotate LC-MS files of derivatized amino acids and polyamines but can be used with any targeted LC-MS workflow.

Input can only be plaintext formats for LC chromatograms and mzML files for the MS data. 

The script starts by parsing and preprocessing the given LC and MS files, interpolating intensity over a linearly-spaced m/z axis, reconstructing extracted ion chromatograms for a given set of peaks and plotting annotated LC spectra. 

# INSTALLATION:
1. Clone the repository. 
2. Install Python 3.12 or later.
3. Install the dependencies listed out in requirements.txt ($ pip3 install -r requirements.txt):
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - matplotlib
    - scipy
    - alive_bar
    - pyteomics
4. Prepare the input data:
    - The script expects the input data to be in the same directory as the script, in the subfolder 'data'.
    - The script expects the LC input data to be in .txt format.
    - The script expects the MS input data to be in .mzml format.
5. (OPTIONAL) Instead of the MS data, pre-annotated .txt files can be supplied if retention times are known (Thermo Chromeleon format).
6. Run the script via main.py file ($ python3 main.py).

The script produces results in the form of .csv files in the 'data/results' folder, alongside plots of calibration curves,
background corrected chromatograms, and recognized peaks in the 'data/plots' folder.
