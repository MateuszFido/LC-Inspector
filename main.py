def run():
    """
    Runs the main analysis pipeline for HPLC/UPLC data.
    
    This function performs the following steps:
    1. Determines the file path to the directory where the script is located.
    2. Supplies the expected peak list, in order of elution.
    3. Grabs the calibration files and measurement files from the specified directory.
    4. Prints the found calibration files and creates an average spectrum.
    5. Grabs the concentrations of the calibration files.
    6. Performs the analysis for each calibration file:
        - Loads the .txt data into a pd.DataFrame.
        - Performs background correction.
        - Detects peaks.
        - Assigns the concentration values from the current file to the compounds.
        - Calculates the calibration curves.
    7. Graphs and returns the curve parameters.
    8. Repeats the same process for the measurement files:
        - Loads the .txt data into a pd.DataFrame.
        - Performs background correction.
        - Detects peaks.
        - Assigns the concentration values from the current file to the compounds.
        - Calculates the concentration of each compound using the curve parameters.
        - Prints the concentration of each compound in the measurement file.
        - Writes the results to a CSV file.
    
    Parameters:

    None
    
    Returns:
